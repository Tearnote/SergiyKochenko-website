# **Event Page for WEB-MOTO**

## **Summary:**
As part of a class hackathon to design a online web application we decided as a group to add an additional page to this previously designed web site which was submitted my our team member Sergiy as part of his PP1 Project. The main goal of this page is to add an additional page for a bike-meetup event. The event would feature a group ride-along and allow users to test drive various motorcycles as part of a sponsorship deal with various bike dealerships across Ukraine.

## **Planning**
To plan for this we first sat down as a group and using the AGILE Software method we first determined the project objectives. After outlining our objectives for the project we began to determine the scope of the project. We done this by creating a multitude of user-stories and using these user stories we where able to create multiple tasks to be completed in the form of iterations. We listed these iterations in levels of importance in accordance with AGILE Product Backlog Principals. We then divided out the tasks amongst the groups members and began the project.
